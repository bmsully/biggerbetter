# BiggerBetter

## Project Description

BiggerBetter is a web app developed by Brady Sullivan in January (IAP) 2022 as a part of MIT web.lab

The main purpose of the app is to provide a platform to arrange 1-for-1 item trades with other users. Upon entering the site, users will be greeted by a brief flow of how the app works as well as examples of the BiggerBetter concept that have appeared in pop-culture. Users will explore the items of other users on the app and when they see an item they think they could trade for, they may propose a trade. After a proposed trade is confirmed, both users may communicate via messager in real-time to determine a time and location for swapping their items. After this, once the items have been physically swapped, they are also digitally swapped on BiggerBetter and the users may continue to search for bigger, better items to trade.

## Deployment
